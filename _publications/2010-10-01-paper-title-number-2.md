Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have become increasingly popular as a sustainable energy source due to the growing need for renewable energy on a global scale. However, the buildup of dust and dirt on solar panels frequently compromises the effectiveness of these systems. Existing cleaning methods often require manual labor, exhibit low efficiency, and are restricted to either a single cleaning method or operational mode. To address these issues, we designed and implemented a semi-autonomous solar panel cleaning robot capable of both dry and wet cleaning. The robot can autonomously navigate on solar panels with a tilt of up to 20° or be manually controlled using a mobile app, and it operates for approximately 75 minutes on a single charge. This study enhances key aspects of the robotic system, integrating advanced edge detection and transition mechanisms using both ultrasonic sensors and image processing techniques. We implemented a robust localization system based on bus-bar detection for precise navigation, upgraded the water supply mechanism and refined the orientation estimation algorithm.
